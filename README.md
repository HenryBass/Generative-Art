# Generative-Art

Algoritmically generated art! A live demo here:

### https://henrybass.github.io/Generative-Art/

All of these images are unique, and are generated every time you load the page.

Here\'s how it works:

1. Picks a random color for the background
2. Sets a scale for the image
3. Generates stroke width, and decides if the stroke should be consistant or varried
4. Generates a stroke bias, to multiply all strokes against to prevent them from being too varried
5. Picks 3 "Shapes" (A line with a start and end point), and assignes a bias to each.
6. Finally, goes through the image and draws the "Shapes" in a grid!

## Have fun messing around with it, and show me what you find!
